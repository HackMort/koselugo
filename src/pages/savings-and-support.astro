          I enjoy understanding a problem or issue, thinking about the possible
          solutions, and coming up with a plan to make the situation better. I
          enjoy accepting challenges that make some uncomfortable and finding a
          way to make something happen for the good of others.

          My #1 goal when helping patients is to give them hope and equip them
          with the resources to manage their condition more effectively.
